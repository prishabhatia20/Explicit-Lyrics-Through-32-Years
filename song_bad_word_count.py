    of bad words and adds the number times each bad word occurs. 
    The function uses lyrics which determins the number of bad words in one song.
    The function also uses a Counter function which was imported from collections 
    which helps add dictionary values together with the same keys.
    Then returns the answer to how many times each bad word occurs. 

    Args:
        year_artist_song: A list with two strings inside them. First is the artist
        and the second is the song name. 
    Returns:
        add_dict: A dictionary with each key being each bad word and each value 
        being a counter for how many times each bad word occurs.
