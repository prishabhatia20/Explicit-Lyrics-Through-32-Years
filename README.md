SoftDes Midterm Project.
There are a couple libraries that are needed in order
to get this code working. Firstly, install wordcloud by going
to the terminal and typing "pip install wordcloud". Next,
beautifulsoup also needs to be installed. To do this, go to the
terminal and type "pip install bs4". Other than that, everything is set.
Go into the main notebook and run all the code!
